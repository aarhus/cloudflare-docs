There's a fundamental problem with malicious bots: they rarely announce what they are.

For example, if a bot operator wants to hoard inventory or test out stolen credit card information, they are likely going to try and impersonate an actual website visitor. Blocking or limiting the bot's access might affect legitimate users.

Much in the same way, other malicious bots pretend to be friendly bots. They might adjust their `user-agent` to be the same as Google's, so it's hard to tell the difference between content indexing and content scraping.

Bot management solutions help you separate bots from humans, and malicious bots from good bots. Once you know where requests are coming from, you can decide which actions your application should take, such as:

- Allowing the request
- Challenging or blocking the request.
- Providing alternative content.
- Redirecting to another page.
- Logging the request for future investigation.
